# My Topic is Library Manaagement System
# A library managemnet system enhances the efficiency of both the librarians and the library users. 
# It is easy to use, highly secure and scalable. This system enables librarians to catalog books 
# and keep proper records of books issued or returned and also books that are added to the library using a database.
# I have made this node application in Visual studio and created table schemas using Mongo Database.
# Hence, I chose this topic for creating node application as it aims to develop a system to maintain the daily work of a library.
